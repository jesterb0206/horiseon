## Description

<br>

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. **Horiseon** is a webpage that is both optimized for search engines and meets accessibility standards. It features semantic HTML elements, accessible alt attributes, a concise, descriptive title and much more!

<br>

## Installation

<br>

No dependencies are required to run **Horiseon** on localhost.

<br>

## Usage

<br>

**Horiseon** is a static webpage, however, it does feature working links in the navigation bar if you wish to learn more about search engine optimization, online reputation management or social media marketing. Please note, the layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the image down below when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px.
